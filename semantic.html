                let's know about Mouse

            </h1>
            <p>
                mouse, (genus Mus), the common name generally but imprecisely applied to rodents found throughout the world with bodies
                less than about 12 cm (5 inches) long. In a scientific context, mouse refers to any of the 38 species in the genus Mus,
                which is the Latin word for mouse. The house mouse (Mus musculus), native to Central Asia, has established itself with
                human populations in many other parts of the world.

        Mice have a slender body, blunt or tapered muzzle, scantily haired, prominent ears, narrow hind feet with bald soles,
        and sharp, small claws. The thinly furred tail appears hairless; it may be about as long as the head and body, or it can
        be much shorter. One of the largest is the flat-haired mouse (M. platythrix) of peninsular India, weighing about 18
        grams (0.6 ounce), with a body 10 to 12 cm (4 to 4.7 inches) long and a shorter tail (7 to 8 cm [2.8 to 3.1 inches]).
        The smallest is probably the pygmy mouse (M. minutoides) of sub-Saharan Africa, weighing 3 to 12 grams (0.11 to 0.42
        ounce), with a body 6 to 8 cm (2.3 to 3.1 inches) long and a short tail of 3 to 6 cm (1.2 to 2.3 inches).
        
        There is considerable variation in fur texture and colour among the species of Mus. At one extreme are the spiny-furred
        species in the subgenus Pyromys, whose upperparts and undersides are covered with flat, channeled spines nestled in soft
        underfur (juveniles are not spiny). At the other extreme are the shrew-mice from Sumatra (M. crociduroides) and Java (M.
        vulcani), whose soft, short, and dense coat appears woolly or velvety. All the other species have a soft or slightly
        coarse, moderately thick coat with short or long hairs. A colour combination common to many mice is gray to brown
        upperparts, white underparts, white feet, and a tail that is dark above and white below. Variations of this pattern
        include upperparts of buff, bluish gray, blackish gray, reddish brown, or chocolate brown, with underparts ranging from
        white to various shades of gray, sometimes tinged with silver or buff. The feet may be white or the same colour as the
        upperparts, and the tail may be bicoloured or uniformly dark gray to dark brown.
